        I've never been there — but Whitehaven Beach in Queensland, Australia
        has always lived in my dreams. With its impossibly white silica sand and
        surreal turquoise waters, it's known as one of the most beautiful
        beaches on Earth.

        Stretching over seven kilometers, this beach is located in the heart of
        the Whitsunday Islands and is only accessible by boat or seaplane —
        making it a true escape into nature.

        This place is perfect for unwinding, snorkeling in crystal-clear
        lagoons, or simply laying under the warm sun, listening to the waves
        kiss the shore.
